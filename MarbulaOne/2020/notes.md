## Race 1: Savage Speedway

* Lap standings were not displayed in the video.  Times were recorded manually for laps 1-9, but many blanks still remain, indicating when the camera did not show a marble crossing the finish line.  This may be updated if the GoPro footage from this race becomes available.
* Video does not show the finish line on Lap 7 when the first two marbles, Starry (Team Glactic) or Prim (Team Primary), cross it.  They first come into view at 3:44.80 at which time Starry is at the conveyor belt and Prim halfway to it.  Their times were extrapolated from the time it took them to travel the same distance after Lap 8.
* Lap times in the file show the total time for the first *n* laps, rather than just lap *n*.  This is noted in the column names.  Accordingly, the times are formatted as `m:ss.00`, rather than `ss.00`.

## Race 2: O'raceway

* Wospy (Midnight Wisps) fell off conveyer belt after completing Lap 3, and was excluded from the standings for the remainder of the race.  His times for Laps 4-8 were recorded manually.
